    <P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Digital Locker, one of the key initiatives under the Digital India initiative, is aimed at eliminating the
        usage of physical documents and enable sharing of e-documents across government agencies via a
        mechanism to verify “authenticity” of the documents online. Residents can also upload their own
        electronic documents and digitally sign them using the e-sign facility. These digitally signed
                documents can be shared with Government organizations or other entities.</B></FONT></P>
