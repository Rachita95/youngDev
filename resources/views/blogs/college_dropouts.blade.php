    Think about some of the most successful and wealthy people in the world. Chances are you might name Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Mukesh Ambani. Other than possession of great wealth, one thing common to all of them - the four business leaders are college dropouts.
    Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard to pursue his love of poetry. Just kidding, he founded Microsoft.
    Mukesh Ambani may have dropped out of his MBA program but that didn’t stop him from becoming the second richest Indian this year.
    Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College to become the father of all things Apple.
    Mark Zuckerberg left Harvard to invent that site you spend way too much time on. According to The Facebook Effect, Zuckerberg “took five minutes to decide” that he would drop out of Harvard.
